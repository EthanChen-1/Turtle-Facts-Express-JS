    <h1>Common Musk Turtle Facts</h1>
    <h2>Scientific Name: Sternotherus odoratus</h2>
    <h3>Native Range: <i>Eastern United States</i></h3>
    <h4>Invasive Level: Not Invasive</h4>

        <p>
            Common Musk turtles only grow upto 5 inches as an adult. <br/>
            They are nocturnal and are active during the night. <br/>
            They are not very strong swimmers, preferring slower waters. <br/>
            Common Musk turtles can be identified by their larger heads and smaller bodies. <br/>
            They are also known as stinkpots because they like to musk when threatened. <br/>
            Common musk turtles are known to carry salmonella. <br/>
            They are omnivores but will mostly only eat meat.

            You don't really need to fill the water up that high, common musk turtles struggle to swim. <br/> 
            Water heater should be 74-83 degrees. You don't want your turtles to freeze but don't cook them either. <br/> 
            Don't use small pebbles for the substrate as mississippi map turtle will eat almost everything that fits into their mouth. <br/>
            Feed younger turtles once a day and feed adults every 2-3 days. <br/>
            Do water changes once a week with dechlorinated water. <br/>
            Don't handle them too much as they can die from the stress of being over-handled. <br/>
            Remember to replace UV bulbs every half a year. <br/>

            Male mississippi map turtles can grow up to 5 inches and females double them in size growing up to 10 inches. <br/>
            They like to swim in turbulent water. <br/>
            Their most distinguishing feature is the saw like protrusions from the top of their shell, and the pattern of the shell is like that of the contour lines on a map. <br/>
            Their diets consist mostly of crustaceans like snails and clams. <br/>
            Mississippi map turtles can live up to 30 years in captivity.

    <h1>Red-Ear Slider Facts</h1>
    <h2>Scientific Name: Trachemys scripta elegans</h2>
    <h3>Native Range: <i>The Southern Mid-West of the United States</i></h3>
    <h4>Highly-invasive species</h4>
    <img src="#" alt="Picture of a red-ear slider">
    <div id="align-center">
        <p>
            Red-ear slider's are one of the most invasive species of animals in the United States. <br/>
            Closely related to the <a href="search?choice=ybs">yellow-bellied slider</a>. <br/>
            Most red-ear sliders are average 6-8 inches in length with the bigger ones growing to 12+ inches. <br/>
            They are easily identifiable by their red patch near their ears. <br/>
            They are referred to as sliders because of how they appear to slide into water at any sign of danger. <br/>
            Red-ear sliders are able to "breathe" through their butts in a process known as cloacal respiration. <br/>
            This species is diurnal meaning they are most active during the day. <br/>
            They can also breathe without much oxygen in a process known as anerobic respiration. <br/>
            Red-ear sliders are omnivores with their diet consisting of insects, fish, and aquatic vegetation. <br/>
            They are carriers of salmonella so becareful when handling red-ear sliders. <br/>
            Lastly red-ear sliders can live upto 40 years in the wild.

            Male yellow-bellied sliders can grow up to 9 inches long while females can grow up to 13 inches long. <br/>
            Closely related to <a href="/search?choice=res">red-ear sliders</a>. <br/>
            Easily identifiable by their dark shells with yellow bands going across the scutes and their yellow underside with black spots. <br/>

            Unlike the red-ear slider, yellow-bellied sliders do not carry the salmonella virus. <br/>
