# turtle-facts-express-js
A rewrite of my turtle facts page using express for easier back-end handling. <br/>
The reason why I chose express is because it makes the back-end simple with more flexibility in how the server handles requests. <br/>
I also wanted to try using a database so I chose MySQL as my first look into relational database management systems.
